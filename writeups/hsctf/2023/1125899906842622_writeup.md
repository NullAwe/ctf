\f0\fs24 \cf0 The way that `b` changes is decided by binary operations, so we do want to take a closer look on the binary of `c`.\
\
Immediately we notice the strange pattern in the lower bits: `1011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010`. It seems apparent that the path to the desired bit is being blocked off by ones.\
\
What I did next was create a tree of possible paths of what `b` could be equal to, based off of different inputs. This led to the realization that when the line `b += (b&c)*(1125899906842622)` actually changed the value of `b`, the value of `b` became very annoying (lots of `1`s in the binary representation) to deal with, and therefore we should seek to avoid this occurence.\
\
Now, since `b` starts off with a single `1` bit, we want to keep this bit in a position where it corresponds to a `0` bit in `c`. We have access to the moves (shift `1` right/left) and (shift `50` right/left).\
\
From here on out, we can either format the binary as a `2`-d array with width `50` (so that we have moves either up, down, left, or right, or we can run a simple BFS algorithm on the binary using these rules as edges to automatically generate the path for us. Here is the script to generate a valid input `a` to the program:\
```cpp\
#include <iostream>\
#include <queue>\
#include <vector>\
#include <algorithm>\
#include <assert.h>\
using namespace std;\
\
#define pii pair<int, int>\
\
vector<int> changes = \{1, -1, 50, -50\};\
\
int main() \{\
  string c = 0; // in reality put binary of c here, it is very long\
  reverse(c.begin(), c.end()); // reverses so we can travel from index 0 to index 2 instead of index -1 to index -3 (works better in my brain)\
  int n = c.size();\
  vector<int> from(n); // tracks both visited array and where it came from\
  // starts BFS:\
  queue<int> q;\
  q.push(0);\
  while (q.size()) \{\
    int v = q.front();\
    q.pop();\
    for (int change : changes) \{\
      int u = v + change;\
      if (u < 0 || u > n || from[u] || c[u] == '1') continue;\
      from[u] = change;\
      q.push(u);\
    \}\
  \}\
  assert(from[2]); // assures that we must have visited bit 2\
  // backtracks to find a:\
  string a = "";\
  int at = 2;\
  while (at != 0) \{\
    if (from[at] == 1) a += "00";\
    else if (from[at] == -1) a += "01";\
    else if (from[at] == 50) a += "10";\
    else a += "11";\
    at -= from[at];\
  \}\
  cout << a << endl; // a is in binary, convert after\
  return 0;\
\}\
```\
\
After converting our binary `a` into decimal, we get `a = 266389209626964670411229630383277269677501566076407503706285515444076594421701235243486016983041387987424513152591848742324465668841041551073869994`.\

Plugging this back into the given program and decoding yields the correct flag.}
